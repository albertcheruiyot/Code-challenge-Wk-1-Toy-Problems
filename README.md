# Code-challenge-Wk-1-Toy-Problems

Code-challenge-Wk-1-Toy-Problems has three challenges. This cahallenges includes Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector and Net Salary Calculator. Below are detailed descriptions and instructions of all of the challenges:
## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

The Grade Calculator is a simple Node.js command-line application that prompts the user to enter a student's marks. Based on the input, it calculates and displays the corresponding grade according to the specified grading scale.

### Grading Scale

- **A:** 80 - 100
- **B:** 60 - 79
- **C:** 50 - 59
- **D:** 40 - 49
- **E:** Less than 40

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Running the Grade Calculator

To run the Grade Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Save the code to a file named `grade.js`.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `grade.js`.
4. Run the command `node grade.js`.
5. When prompted, enter the student's marks (0-100) and press Enter.

The program will then display the grade based on the marks you've entered.
## Challenge 2: Speed Detector
A JavaScript program designed to monitor driving speeds and enforce safe driving practices by calculating demerit points for speeds above legal limits. A program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Running the Speed Detector

To run the Speed Detector, follow these steps:

1. Save the code to a file named `speed.js`.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `speed.js`.
4. Run the command `node speed.js`.
5. When prompted, follow prompt instructions.

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
A program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.

**NB:** Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

1. Save the code to a file named `salary.js`.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `salary.js`.
4. Run the command `node salary.js`.
5. When prompted, follow prompt instructions.
